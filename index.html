		<div class="description">
		My personal website from 2015 - 2016. Created from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. I drew inspiration from the sky and featured moving clouds, stars, falling rain, glowing sun, and color changing background/sky. I considered putting my face inside the sun Teletubbies style on the about page but thought that would be too creepy. Retired this website design because I felt like a change but the full website can still be explored with the link on the right.

		<div class="description">
		Born out of my love for the written word, I created this Tumblr blog in 2011 in which quotes from literature are posted frequently up until this day. As of December 2016, ASQ has over 305,000 followers and over 2 million visits. Instead of using pre-made Tumblr themes, I wrote and designed the theme myself from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JS on Tumblr's code editor. I've expanded The Sea of Quotes brand to Facebook (over 8K likes), Twitter (over 1K followers), and Pinterest (over 1.8K followers) and designed ASQ and literature themed shirts, selling them on The Seas Apparel, a Spreadshirt store.

		<div class="title">A Sea of Quotes iOS App</div>
		<div class="description">
		In 2012, I decided to make an iOS app for my Tumblr blog, A Sea of Quotes. However, I knew nothing about coding or computer science at the time and the free app generators I played with did not have the functionality or look I wanted. So 4 years later in my iOS class when the final project was whatever we desired, I chose to fulfill my dream of making an iOS app for A Sea of Quotes. The app is more user-friendly for quote-hunting than the Tumblr app or mobile version of the blog in that the quotes you save will only be quotes saved to the Core Data of the phone for easy viewing later as opposed to the Tumblr app where it may be a mix of your likes throughout the Tumblr platform, you can easily search for quotes which cannot be done in the Tumblr app, and a more consistent feel/look with the theme of ASQ which is difficult to customize on the Tumblr app. While the basic functionality works, this app could use some improvements in the UI and loading times that I'm working on to eventually put on the App Store one day.

		<div class="description">
		I was brought on to the Virtual Reality @ Berkeley club to redesign and maintain their website as the Web and Digital Infrastructure Manager and to gain insight in VR development and industry. Using the pre-existing style guide, I redesigned their website in a way consistent to their brand image while trying to avoid looking like all the other Bootstrap-layout club websites. Additionally, I was one of the social media managers, designing most of the Facebook cover photos for VR@B events such as general meetings, bootcamps, and demos on Photoshop. As an officer, I had other responsibilities such as giving input during meetings and helping set up info sessions and conference.

		<div class="description">
		The User and Interface Design Class at Berkeley, CS160, divided us into groups based on our skill sets. I was placed in a group with Simon Cao, Zach Hawtof, Ryan Kapur, and Hector Gonzalez. As a group, we went through the whole design process, including brainstorming, conducting user interviews, wireframing, prototyping, coding, and presenting the final product. As the theme of the semester was focused on healthcare, we decided to target an uncommon audience -- alcoholics. The app idea: to help alcoholics find AA meetings best fit for them to encourage them to stay sober. We thought of an idea, compared it to competitors already in the market, interviewed alcoholics, and attended AA meetings to make sure what we created wouldn't be condescending or unhelpful. My responsibilites laid heavily more on the design and execution of presentation side, also making sure that teammates were kept on track. Although our group was formed by the staff, it worked out wonderfully. I had such an amazing time with them, our group chat was popping with GIFS, and we always encouraged and helped each other out.

		<div class="description">
		The Critical Practices class at UC Berkeley, CNM190, divided us into groups almost randomly. I was placed in a group with Serena Chang, Alice Pang, Mark Lam, and Ingrid Hong. As a group, we went through the whole design process, including brainstorming, conducting user interviews, wireframing, prototyping, coding, and presenting the final product. Our chosen community for this assignment were dance teams in Berkeley. Our focus was on freestyle circles and how to encourage shy people to participate and foster a closer community within these dance teams. Some components used were a Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi camera module, speaker, light, WiFi dongle, and a laser cutter for the acrylic casing and GrooveCube stickers. The idea is to press the button on the GC, which will play a song and record someone dancing for a set amount of time. You then pass the GC to a friend, who records themselves dancing to the next portion of the song, and so on. At the end, the GC uses Python scripts to concatenate the videos using FFMPEG, then uploads the video to YouTube. We also made packaging for the GC with simple instructions. In this way, virtual freestyle videos can be formed. I was mainly responsible for design, debugging, and final presentation items.

		<div class="description">
		I interned at Juniper Networks as a Technical Marketing Engineer/Software Developer intern under Product Line Management, JDI division. My main intern project was solving the problem of customers not making use of Juniper's automation tools and scripts. One reason to this problem is that Juniper's resources are scattered everywhere, making starting automation a hassle to some. So I created a website with Linux, Apache 2, MySQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS to search through a database of automation tools and code such as PyEZ and Slax scripts to expand awareness and usability of automation. Since my Automation Tools and Code Index highly resembled a Pokedex, which are used to search for Pokemon, I decided to do a Pokemon theme for the intern showcase, with automation tools and scripts as the Pokemon. Made video with dubbed subtitles about my project, stickers and handouts as Pokemon cards with information on various automation tools and links to the site itself. The site can only be accessed within Juniper's VPN, but links to the showcase presentation and video are on the right. Shoutout to my awesome managers for believing in and being there for me.

		Before writing code I wrote novels. NaNoWriMo is National Novel Writing Month in which you must write at least 50K words of a novel in the month of November. When you win NaNoWriMo, you can print your novel with CreateSpace. Here is a picture of a few of my novels. Crossed out the title names because they were too embarrassing. Because of my love for creative writing, I know how important it is to tell a story, and to tell it well.
